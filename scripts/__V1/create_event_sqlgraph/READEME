This file is used to explain the usage of executable files.

The function:
1.'Create_sqlgraph_from_mongo_es.py' can be used to select data from 'es' and 'mongodb' and save it as a file in csv format.

2.The 'data_test' folder and the files it contains should be located at 'sqlgraph@10.60.1.143'. Run 'create_event graph.sh' to move the relevant files into 'sqlgraph@10.60.1.143:data_test/event', create a sqlgraph database and import the table.

How to use those files:
1.sh run.py. After an hour of operation, it will transfer the file to 'sqlgraph@10.60.1.143:data_test'. At this time, you need to enter the password of the 'sqlgraph' account sqlgraph.
2.sh create_event_graph.sh.
